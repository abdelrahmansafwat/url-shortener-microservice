# url-shortener-microservice
The URL Shortener Microservice project for freeCodeCamp's APIs and Microservices Certification

Note: I added my own twist to the project. I didn't like how the short URL was always a number that kept incrementing (e.g.: host.com/1, host.com/2, etc.) as that was easily predictable. So, I used the crypto library to generate an 8 character random sequence for each short url (e.g.: host.com/LPaS2upL).
